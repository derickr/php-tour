<h1>Hello Earthling</h1>

<p>
Welcome to the tour of the PHP programming language.
</p>

<p>
This tour will guide you through PHP's syntax. From variables, functions, classes, to types. We will cover it all.
</p>

<p>
On the side, you see a panel where you can enter PHP source code. Clicking on "Run code" makes the code run, and show the output.
</p>

<p>
Try it out!
</p>

<p>
Now change <code>Earthling</code> to your name, and click "Run code" once more.
</p>

<p>
If you have done something wrong, you can always reset to the original code with the "Reset code" button.
</p>

<p>
Try that out too!
</p>

<p>
Now you are ready for your first lesson. Click on "Next" to go there.
</p>

<p>
You can also use the navigation at the top of the page to find a table of contents with all the modules and lessons.
