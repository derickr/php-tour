<p>
Let's first look how variables work. Variables can be used to store information.
</p>

<p>
In PHP, all variables start with <code>$</code>, and they are case-sensitive.
</p>

<p>
Variables do not need to be declared nor typed. You can assign any value to it!
</p>

<p>
The <code>echo</code> keyword can be used to show the contents of a variable.
</p>

<p>
Each variable, can also contain values of different types, such as a <code>string</code>, <code>number</code> (we call those integers or doubles), and <code>boolean</code>, and many more.
</p>

<p>
You can see that for the boolean <code>true</code> value, PHP shows <code>1</code>. If you change it to <code>false</code>, PHP shows nothing. Try it out!
</p>

<p>
On the next page, we will look at some other ways of doing this.
