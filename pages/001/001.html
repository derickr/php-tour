<h1>Display</h1>

<p>
In the previous page we saw that you can use <code>echo</code> for displaying the value of a variable. But there are other ways.
</p>

<p>
Although PHP has good debugging tools, in some cases (like here) you might want to use the <code>var_dump()</code> function.
</p>

<p>
Run the code, and see what it outputs.
</p>

<p>
Instead of showing nothing, it also shows the type with the value.
</p>

<p>
Now try changing the value of the <code>$myVariable</code> variable to a whole range of different things, such as <code>"My mother is a hamster"</code>, or <code>88.8</code>.
